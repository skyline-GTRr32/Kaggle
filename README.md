# Kaggle Projects

Welcome to my Kaggle projects repository! This repo contains my solutions to various Kaggle challenges, showcasing my data science and machine learning skills. Each challenge is organized in its own folder, complete with code, documentation, and related files.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: To document and share my Kaggle journey, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
- **Languages/Tools**: Primarily Python, with libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.
- **Future Plans**: Future Plans: I will add more Kaggle challenges over time, such as e.g., House Prices, Digit Recognizer. .

## Projects

### 1. Titanic Challenge
- **Folder**: `titanic-challenge`
- **Description**: Predicts which passengers survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, class, etc.
- **Score**: Achieved 0.78 on the Kaggle leaderboard.
- **Files**:
  - `titanic_model.py`: Main script for data cleaning, feature engineering, model training (Random Forest Classifier), and submission generation.
  - `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
  - `train.csv`, `test.csv`: Training and test datasets (downloadable from [Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)).
- **How to Run**:
  1. Download `train.csv` and `test.csv` from the Kaggle Titanic Challenge page.
  2. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r titanic-challenge/requirements.txt
